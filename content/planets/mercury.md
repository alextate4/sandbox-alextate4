Mercury does have the biggest temperature fluctuations in the solar system. Temperature on the dayside can be as hot as 800°F (430°C) but the night side is -290°F (-180°C). That’s a 1130°F (610°C) difference!

It is also the fastest moving planet. It goes around the Sun at 105,906 mph (170,503 km/h) compared to Earth that only goes 66,622 mph (107,208 km/h). Which amounts to 29 miles (47 km) every second!

It spins almost completely upright. It’s only titled 1/30 of a degree on its axis- the next closest is Jupiter with a 3.1 degree tilt. Mercury is also mostly core. The crust is only 250 miles (400 km) thick making 85% of the planet the core. To compare, Earth’s core is 55% its mass.

Because of how the orbits line up, Mercury actually spends more time being closer to Earth than Venus.
